### Cryptographic Algorithms (WIP)

Cryptographic algorithms are methods used to secure data through encryption, hashing, and key exchange techniques. They ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and authenticity of information in digital communications.

1- [RSA (Asymmetric Encryption)](./rsa.md): RSA is a public-key encryption algorithm that uses two keys, one for encryption and one for decryption. It is widely used for secure data transmission.

2- [AES (Symmetric Encryption)](./aes.md): AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) is a symmetric encryption algorithm that uses the same key for both encryption and decryption. It is known for its speed and security.

3- [SHA-256 (Hashing)](./sha-256.md): SHA-256 (Secure Hash Algorithm 256-bit) is a cryptographic hash function that produces a fixed-size 256-bit hash value. It is commonly used for data integrity verification.

4- [Diffie-Hellman (Key Exchange)](./diffie-hellman.md): Diffie-Hellman is a key exchange algorithm that allows two parties to securely share a secret key over an insecure channel. It is fundamental to many cryptographic protocols.

5- [Bcrypt (Hashing)](./bcrypt.md): Bcrypt is a password hashing function designed to be computationally intensive to protect against brute-force attacks. It incorporates a salt to protect against rainbow table attacks.
