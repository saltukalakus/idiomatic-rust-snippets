### Searching Algorithms (WIP)

Searching algorithms are designed to retrieve information stored within some data structure. They are fundamental to computer science and are used to solve a variety of problems. 

1- [Linear Search](./linear.md): A simple search algorithm that checks every element in the data structure until the desired element is found or the end is reached.

2- [Binary Search](./binary.md): An efficient search algorithm that works on sorted data structures by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half until the target value is found or the interval is empty.

3- [Depth-First Search (DFS)](./depth-first.md): An algorithm for traversing or searching tree or graph data structures, which starts at the root and explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking.

4- [Breadth-First Search (BFS)](./breadth-first.md): An algorithm for traversing or searching tree or graph data structures, which starts at the root and explores all neighbor nodes at the present depth prior to moving on to nodes at the next depth level.
