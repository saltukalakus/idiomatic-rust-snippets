### Graph Algorithms

Graph algorithms are a set of instructions designed to solve problems related to graph theory. These algorithms help in finding the shortest path, detecting cycles, finding the minimum spanning tree, and more. They are widely used in various fields such as computer networks, social networks, and geographical information systems.

1- [Dijkstra’s Algorithm (Shortest Path)](./shortest-path.md): An algorithm for finding the shortest paths between nodes in a graph, which may represent, for example, road networks.

2- [Kruskal’s Algorithm (Minimum Spanning Tree)](./minimum-spanning-tree.md): An algorithm for finding the minimum spanning tree for a connected weighted graph, ensuring that the total weight of the tree is minimized.

3- [A* Algorithm (Pathfinding)](./a-star.md): A pathfinding and graph traversal algorithm, which is often used in many fields of computer science due to its performance and accuracy.

4- [Floyd-Warshall Algorithm (All-Pairs Shortest Path)](./all-pairs-shortest-path.md): An algorithm for finding shortest paths in a weighted graph with positive or negative edge weights (but with no negative cycles), computing the shortest paths between all pairs of nodes.
