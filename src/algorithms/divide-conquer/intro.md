### Divide and Conquer Algorithms (WIP)

Divide and conquer algorithms work by recursively breaking down a problem into two or more sub-problems of the same or related type, until these become simple enough to be solved directly. The solutions to the sub-problems are then combined to give a solution to the original problem.

1- [Merge Sort](./merge-sort.md): A stable, comparison-based, divide and conquer sorting algorithm. It divides the input array into two halves, recursively sorts them, and then merges the sorted halves.

2- [QuickSort](./quick-sort.md): An efficient, comparison-based, divide and conquer sorting algorithm. It picks an element as a pivot, partitions the array around the pivot, and recursively sorts the sub-arrays.

3- [Binary Search](./binary-search.md): A search algorithm that finds the position of a target value within a sorted array. It compares the target value to the middle element of the array and recursively searches the sub-array.
