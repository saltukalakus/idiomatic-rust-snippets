### Algorithms

Algorithms are step-by-step procedures for solving problems or performing computations. This section demonstrates various classic algorithms implemented in Rust, showcasing efficient problem-solving techniques and data structure manipulation.

1- [Sorting Algorithms](./sorting/intro.md): Arrange data in a specific order (ascending, descending, etc.).

2- [Searching Algorithms](./searching/intro.md): Locate specific data in a dataset.

3- [Graph Algorithms](./graph/intro.md): Solve problems involving graphs (nodes and edges).

4- [Dynamic Programming Algorithms](./dynamic-programming/intro.md): Solve complex problems by breaking them 
down into overlapping subproblems.

5- [Cryptographic Algorithms](./cryptographic): Secure data and communications.
