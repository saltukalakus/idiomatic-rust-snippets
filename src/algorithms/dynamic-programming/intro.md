### Dynamic Programming Algorithms

Dynamic programming is a method for solving complex problems by breaking them down into simpler subproblems. It is applicable when the problem has overlapping subproblems that can be solved independently. The solutions are stored (memoized) to avoid redundant computations, making the algorithm more efficient.

1- [Knapsack Problem](./knapsack-problem.md): This problem involves selecting a subset of items with given weights and values to maximize the total value without exceeding a specified weight limit.

2- [Longest Common Subsequence](./longest-common-subsequence.md): This algorithm finds the longest subsequence common to two sequences, which may not be contiguous, to determine their similarity.

3- [Matrix Chain Multiplication](./matrix-chain-multiplication.md): This problem focuses on finding the most efficient way to multiply a given sequence of matrices by determining the optimal order of multiplications.

4- [Fibonacci Sequence](./fibonacci.md): This algorithm generates the Fibonacci sequence, where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, starting from 0 and 1.
