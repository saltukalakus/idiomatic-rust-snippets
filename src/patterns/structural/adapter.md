### Adapter Design Pattern

The Adapter pattern allows incompatible interfaces to work together. This is useful when you want to use a class that doesn't have the exact interface you need.

Here is an example of the Adapter Design Pattern:

```rust
// The existing interface that we want to adapt
trait Target {
    fn request(&self) -> String;
}

// The adaptee class with a different interface
struct Adaptee;

impl Adaptee {
    fn specific_request(&self) -> String {
        "specific request".to_string()
    }
}

// The adapter class that makes Adaptee compatible with Target
struct Adapter {
    adaptee: Adaptee,
}

impl Adapter {
    fn new(adaptee: Adaptee) -> Self {
        Adapter { adaptee }
    }
}

impl Target for Adapter {
    fn request(&self) -> String {
        // Translate the interface of Adaptee to the Target interface
        self.adaptee.specific_request()
    }
}

fn main() {
    let adaptee = Adaptee;
    let adapter = Adapter::new(adaptee);

    // Client code can use the adapter as if it were a Target
    println!("Adapter request: {}", adapter.request());
}
```

1. **Target Trait**: Defines the interface that the client expects.
2. **Adaptee Struct**: The existing class with a different interface that needs to be adapted.
3. **Adapter Struct**: Implements the `Target` trait and translates the interface of `Adaptee` to the `Target` interface.
4. **main() Function**: Demonstrates the usage of the adapter to make `Adaptee` compatible with the `Target` interface.

This example shows how the Adapter pattern can be used to make two incompatible interfaces work together.
