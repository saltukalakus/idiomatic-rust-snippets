### Proxy Design Pattern

The Proxy pattern provides a surrogate or placeholder for another object to control access to it. This can be useful for various purposes such as lazy initialization, access control, logging, etc.

Here is an example of the Proxy Design Pattern:

```rust
trait Subject {
    fn request(&self) -> String;
}

struct RealSubject;

impl Subject for RealSubject {
    fn request(&self) -> String {
        "RealSubject: Handling request.".to_string()
    }
}

struct Proxy {
    real_subject: RealSubject,
}

impl Proxy {
    fn new() -> Self {
        Proxy {
            real_subject: RealSubject,
        }
    }
}

impl Subject for Proxy {
    fn request(&self) -> String {
        println!("Proxy: Logging access to RealSubject.");
        self.real_subject.request()
    }
}

fn main() {
    let proxy = Proxy::new();
    println!("{}", proxy.request());
}
```

1. **Subject Trait**: Defines the common interface for `RealSubject` and `Proxy`.
2. **RealSubject Struct**: Implements the `Subject` trait and contains the actual business logic.
3. **Proxy Struct**: Contains a reference to `RealSubject` and implements the `Subject` trait to control access to `RealSubject`.
4. **Proxy::new() Method**: Creates a new instance of the `Proxy` with an instance of `RealSubject`.
5. **main() Function**: Demonstrates the usage of the proxy to control access to the `RealSubject`.

This example shows how the `Proxy` can control access to the `RealSubject` and add additional behavior such as logging.
