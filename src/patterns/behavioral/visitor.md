### Visitor Pattern

The visitor pattern is a behavioral design pattern that allows you to add further operations to objects without having to modify them. It involves creating a visitor class that implements a visitor interface and then passing it to elements of the object structure.

Here is an example:

```rust
{{#include visitor/src/main.rs}}
```

In this example:
* The `Visitor` trait defines methods for visiting different types of elements.
* The `Element` trait defines an `accept` method that takes a mutable reference to a `Visitor`.
* `ElementA` and `ElementB` are concrete implementations of the `Element` trait.
* `ConcreteVisitor` is a concrete implementation of the `Visitor` trait.
* In the `main` function, we create a list of elements and a visitor, and then we iterate over the elements, passing the visitor to each element's `accept` method.

This pattern allows you to add new operations to existing object structures without modifying those structures.
