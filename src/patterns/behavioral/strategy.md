### Strategy Pattern

The strategy pattern defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable. This pattern lets the algorithm vary independently from clients that use it.

Here's a simple example of the strategy pattern:

1. Strategy Trait: Defines a common interface for all supported algorithms.<br/>
2. Concrete Strategies: Implement the Strategy trait for different algorithms.<br/>
3. Context: Maintains a reference to a Strategy object and is configured with a Concrete Strategy object.<br/>
4. Main Function: Creates instances of different strategies and the context, then executes the strategies within the context.<br/>

```rust
{{#include strategy/src/main.rs}}
```

This pattern is useful for scenarios where you need to switch between different algorithms or behaviors at runtime.
