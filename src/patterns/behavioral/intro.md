### Behavioral Patterns

Behavioral Patterns deal with object collaboration and the delegation of responsibilities. 

### Some Common Behavioral Design Patterns

1- [Observer](./observer.md): Defines a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all its dependents are notified and updated automatically.

2- [Strategy](./strategy.md): Defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable.

3- [Command](./command.md): Encapsulates a request as an object, thereby allowing for parameterization of clients with queues, requests, and operations.
