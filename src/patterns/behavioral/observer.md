### Observer Pattern

The observer pattern is a behavioral design pattern where an object (the subject) maintains a list of its dependents (observers) and notifies them of any state changes, usually by calling one of their methods.

Here is an example:

```rust
{{#include observer/src/main.rs}}
```

In this example:

* Observer Trait: Defines the update method that observers must implement.
* Subject Struct: Manages a list of observers and notifies them of changes.
* Concrete Observers: Implement the Observer trait and define the update method.
* Main Function: Demonstrates the pattern by creating a subject, adding observers, and notifying them.

This setup allows the subject to notify all registered observers whenever a change occurs, following the Observer pattern principles.
