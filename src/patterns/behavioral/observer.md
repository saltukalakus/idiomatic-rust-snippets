The Observer pattern is a behavioral design pattern where an object (the subject) maintains a list of its dependents (observers) and notifies them of any state changes, usually by calling one of their methods.

### Step-by-Step Plan

1- **Define the Observer trait**: Create a trait that observers must implement.

```rust,noplaypen
{{#include observer/src/observer.rs}}
```

2- **Define the Subject struct**: Create a struct that maintains a list of observers and notifies them of changes.

```rust,noplaypen
{{#include observer/src/subject.rs}}
```

3- **Implement the Observer trait for concrete observers**: Create concrete observer structs that implement the Observer trait.

```rust,noplaypen
{{#include observer/src/concrete_observer.rs}}
```

4- **Demonstrate the Observer pattern in the main function**: Create a subject, add observers, and notify them of changes.

```rust,noplaypen
{{#include observer/src/main.rs}}
```
