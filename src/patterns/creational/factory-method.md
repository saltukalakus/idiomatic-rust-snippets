### Factory Method Pattern

The Factory Method is a creational design pattern that provides an interface for creating objects in a superclass but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created.

In Rust, the Factory Method pattern can be implemented using traits and structs. The trait defines the method for creating objects, and the structs implement this trait to create specific types of objects.

## Example

Let's consider an example where we have a `Shape` trait and two structs `Circle` and `Square` that implement this trait. We will create a `ShapeFactory` trait with a method `create_shape` and two factories `CircleFactory` and `SquareFactory` that implement this trait.

```rust
// Define the Shape trait
trait Shape {
    fn draw(&self);
}

// Implement the Shape trait for Circle
struct Circle;

impl Shape for Circle {
    fn draw(&self) {
        println!("Drawing a Circle");
    }
}

// Implement the Shape trait for Square
struct Square;

impl Shape for Square {
    fn draw(&self) {
        println!("Drawing a Square");
    }
}

// Define the ShapeFactory trait
trait ShapeFactory {
    fn create_shape(&self) -> Box<dyn Shape>;
}

// Implement the ShapeFactory trait for CircleFactory
struct CircleFactory;

impl ShapeFactory for CircleFactory {
    fn create_shape(&self) -> Box<dyn Shape> {
        Box::new(Circle)
    }
}

// Implement the ShapeFactory trait for SquareFactory
struct SquareFactory;

impl ShapeFactory for SquareFactory {
    fn create_shape(&self) -> Box<dyn Shape> {
        Box::new(Square)
    }
}

fn main() {
    // Create a Circle using CircleFactory
    let circle_factory = CircleFactory;
    let circle = circle_factory.create_shape();
    circle.draw();

    // Create a Square using SquareFactory
    let square_factory = SquareFactory;
    let square = square_factory.create_shape();
    square.draw();
}
```

## Output

```
Drawing a Circle
Drawing a Square
```

In this example, the `ShapeFactory` trait defines the `create_shape` method, and the `CircleFactory` and `SquareFactory` structs implement this method to create specific shapes. This allows for flexibility in creating different types of shapes without changing the client code.
