### Prototype Design Pattern

The Prototype Design Pattern is a creational design pattern that allows an object to create a copy of itself. This pattern is useful when the cost of creating a new object is expensive or complex. Instead of creating a new instance from scratch, you clone an existing instance.

In Rust, we can use the `Clone` trait to implement the Prototype Design Pattern.

```rust
#[derive(Clone)]
struct Prototype {
    field1: String,
    field2: i32,
}

impl Prototype {
    fn new(field1: String, field2: i32) -> Self {
        Prototype { field1, field2 }
    }

    fn clone_prototype(&self) -> Self {
        self.clone()
    }
}

fn main() {
    let original = Prototype::new(String::from("Original"), 42);
    let cloned = original.clone_prototype();

    println!("Original: {} - {}", original.field1, original.field2);
    println!("Cloned: {} - {}", cloned.field1, cloned.field2);
}
```

1. **Define the Prototype Structure**: We define a `Prototype` struct with some fields.
2. **Implement the `Clone` Trait**: We derive the `Clone` trait for the `Prototype` struct to enable cloning.
3. **Constructor Method**: We provide a `new` method to create a new instance of `Prototype`.
4. **Clone Method**: We define a `clone_prototype` method that returns a clone of the current instance.
5. **Usage**: In the `main` function, we create an original instance and then clone it using the `clone_prototype` method.

This pattern is particularly useful when dealing with complex objects that are expensive to create, as it allows for efficient copying of existing instances.
