### Creational Patterns

Creational Patterns deal with object creation mechanisms, trying to create objects in a manner suitable to the situation.

### Some Common Creational Design Patterns

1- [Singleton](./singleton.md): Ensures a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it.

2- [Factory Method](./factory-method.md): Defines an interface for creating an object, but lets subclasses alter the type of objects that will be created.

3- [Abstract Factory](./abstract-factory.md): Provides an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes.

4- [Builder](./builder.md): Separates the construction of a complex object from its representation so that the same construction process can create different representations.

5- [Prototype](./prototype.md): Specifies the kinds of objects to create using a prototypical instance, and creates new objects by copying this prototype.
