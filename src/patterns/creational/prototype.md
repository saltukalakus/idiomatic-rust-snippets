### Prototype Design Pattern

he Prototype Design Pattern is a creational pattern that allows cloning of objects, even complex ones, without coupling to their specific classes. This pattern is particularly useful when the cost of creating a new instance of a class is expensive or complicated.

We can implement the Prototype pattern using the `Clone` trait.

```rust
#[derive(Clone)]
struct Prototype {
    field1: String,
    field2: i32,
}

impl Prototype {
    fn new(field1: String, field2: i32) -> Self {
        Prototype { field1, field2 }
    }

    fn clone_prototype(&self) -> Self {
        self.clone()
    }
}

fn main() {
    let original = Prototype::new(String::from("Prototype"), 42);
    let cloned = original.clone_prototype();

    println!("Original: {} - {}", original.field1, original.field2);
    println!("Cloned: {} - {}", cloned.field1, cloned.field2);
}
```

- We define a `Prototype` struct with two fields.
- We derive the `Clone` trait for the `Prototype` struct, which provides the `clone` method.
- We implement a `clone_prototype` method that clones the current instance.
- In the `main` function, we create an instance of `Prototype` and then clone it using the `clone_prototype` method.

This demonstrates how the Prototype pattern can be implemented in Rust using the `Clone` trait.
