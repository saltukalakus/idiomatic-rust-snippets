### Design Patterns

Patterns help to have reusable solutions to common problems that occur in software design. These patterns provide a template or blueprint for solving a particular problem in a specific context. They help developers avoid reinventing the wheel.

**Note**: This section focuses on Rust-idiomatic implementations. Some traditional OOP patterns have been renamed or removed when Rust offers better alternatives.

1- [Creational Patterns](./creational/intro.md): Deal with object creation mechanisms, adapted for Rust's ownership model.

2- [Behavioral Patterns](./behavioral/intro.md): Deal with object collaboration and the delegation of responsibilities.

3- [Structural Patterns](./structural/intro.md): Deal with object composition or the structure of classes and objects.

4- [Rust Idioms](./rust-idioms/intro.md): Patterns unique to Rust that leverage the ownership system, type system, and zero-cost abstractions.
