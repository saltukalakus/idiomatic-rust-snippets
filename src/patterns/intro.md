### Design Patterns

Patterns help to have reusable solutions to common problems that occur in software design. These patterns provide a template or blueprint for solving a particular problem in a specific context. They help developers avoid reinventing the wheel.

1- [Creational Patterns](./creational/intro.md): Deal with object creation mechanisms, trying to create objects in a manner suitable to the situation.

2- [Behavioral Patterns](./behavioral/intro.md): Deal with object collaboration and the delegation of responsibilities.

3- [Structural Patterns](./structural/intro.md): Deal with object composition or the structure of classes and objects.
