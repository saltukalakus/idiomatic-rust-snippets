# Comparison Operators

Comparison operators are used to compare two values and return a boolean result.

== : Equal to
!= : Not equal to
> : Greater than
< : Less than
>= : Greater than or equal to
<= : Less than or equal to

```rust
fn main() {
    let a = 10;
    let b = 3;

    println!("a == b: {}", a == b); // Equal to
    println!("a != b: {}", a != b); // Not equal to
    println!("a > b: {}", a > b); // Greater than
    println!("a < b: {}", a < b); // Less than
    println!("a >= b: {}", a >= b); // Greater than or equal to
    println!("a <= b: {}", a <= b); // Less than or equal to
}
```
