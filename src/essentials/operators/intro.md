### Operators

Operators are special symbols or keywords that are used to perform operations on variables and values. Rust supports a variety of operators for different purposes.

1- [Arithmetic Operations](./arithmetic-operations.md): Operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and modulus.

2- [Comparison Operations](./comparison-operations.md): Operators for comparing values like equal to, not equal to, greater than, and less than.

3- [Logical Operations](./logical-operations.md): Boolean logic operators like AND, OR, and NOT.

4- [Bitwise Operations](./bitwise-operations.md): Operations that work on individual bits of values.

5- [Assignment Operations](./assignement-operations.md): Operators for assigning values to variables, including compound assignment operators.
