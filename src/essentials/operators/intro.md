### What are operators?

Operators are special symbols or keywords that are used to perform operations on variables and values. Rust supports a variety of operators, including [arithmetic](./arithmetic-operations.md), [comparison](./comparison-operations.md), [logical](./logical-operations.md), [bitwise](./bitwise-operations.md), and [assignment](./assignement-operations.md) operators.
