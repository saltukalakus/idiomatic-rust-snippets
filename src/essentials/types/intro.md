### Types

Types in Rust define the kind of data that can be stored and manipulated within a program. Rust is a statically typed language, which means that the type of every variable must be known at compile time. This helps catch many errors early in the development process and ensures memory safety.

1- [Scalar Types](./scalar.md): Single value types including integers, floating-point numbers, booleans, and characters.

2- [Compound Types](./compound.md): Types that group multiple values into one, including tuples and arrays.

3- [Struct](./struct.md): Custom data types that allow you to group related data together with associated methods.

4- [Enum](./enum.md): Types that enumerate possible values, with each variant optionally containing associated data.

5- [Trait](./trait.md): A way to define shared behavior in an abstract way, similar to interfaces in other languages.

6- [Generic](./generic.md): Write flexible and reusable code that can operate on many different types without sacrificing performance.

7- [Associated Types](./associated-types.md): Associate type placeholders with traits for cleaner APIs and better type inference.

8- [Pointer](./pointer.md): Types that represent memory addresses, used to reference data stored in memory with Rust's safety guarantees.

9- [Vector](./vector.md): A growable array type for dynamic collections that can grow or shrink at runtime.

10- [Type Alias](./type-alias.md): Create alternative names for existing types to improve code readability.

11- [PhantomData](./phantom-data.md): Zero-sized marker type for compile-time type checking and type-state patterns.

12- [Reference vs Smart Pointer](./reference-vs-smart-pointer.md): Understanding the differences between regular references and smart pointers.

13- [Struct vs Enum](./struct-vs-enum.md): When to use structs versus enums in your Rust code.
