### Standard Library

This section explains some of the common standard library APIs and their usage for everyday programming tasks. The intention is not to cover the entire API, but to provide practical examples of frequently used functionality.

1- [Vec](./vec.md): Growable array type for dynamic collections that can grow or shrink at runtime.

2- [HashMap](./hashmap.md): Collection that stores key-value pairs for efficient lookups by key.

3- [Option](./option.md): Enum representing a value that can be something (`Some`) or nothing (`None`), avoiding null pointer issues.

4- [RefCell](./refcell.md): Interior mutability pattern that allows mutable borrows checked at runtime.

5- [Rc](./rc.md): Reference counting pointer for shared ownership of data.

6- [Self](./self.md): The `self` keyword in method definitions and implementations.

7- [Self as Type](./self-as-type.md): Using `Self` as a type alias in trait implementations.

8- [self vs Self](./self-vs-self.md): Understanding the difference between lowercase `self` and uppercase `Self`.

9- [Some](./some.md): The `Some` variant of the `Option` enum for wrapping values.

10- [New](./new.md): Convention for constructor functions in Rust.

11- [Derive(Debug)](./drive(debug).md): Automatically implementing the Debug trait for custom types.

12- [Impl](./imp.md): Implementing methods and associated functions for types.
