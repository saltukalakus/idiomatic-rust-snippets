### Self vs self in Rust

In Rust, `Self` and `self` have different meanings and uses:

- `Self` refers to the type that is implementing a trait or a method. It is used in type definitions and associated functions.
- `self` refers to the instance of the type that is implementing a method. It is used in method signatures and method bodies.

Here is an example to illustrate the difference:

```rust
struct MyStruct;

impl MyStruct {
    // Associated function, uses `Self`
    fn new() -> Self {
        MyStruct
    }

    // Method, uses `self`
    fn consume(self) {
        // consume the instance
    }
}
```

In this example:
- `Self` is used in the `new` function to refer to the type `MyStruct`.
- `self` is used in the `consume` method to refer to the instance of `MyStruct`.
