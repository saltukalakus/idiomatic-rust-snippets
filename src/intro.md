### Idiomatic Rust Snippets

1- [Essentials](./essentials/intro.md) covers the basic aspects of the Rust programming language. They are explained with easy to grasp samples.

2- [Design Patterns](./patterns/intro.md) section demonstrates several design patterns with minimalistic but complete projects.

This book does not intend to explain every aspect of Rust; however, you may find it useful while learning Rust. 

I am expanding it as I use and learn this awesome language. It is my memory map and grows organically.
