### Idiomatic Rust Snippets

1. [Essentials](./essentials/intro.md) covers the basic aspects of the Rust programming language. They are explained with easy-to-understand examples.

2. [Design Patterns](./patterns/intro.md) section demonstrates several design patterns with minimalistic but complete projects.

3. [Algorithms](./algorithms/intro.md) section explains various popular algorithms with code samples in Rust. (WIP)

This book does not intend to explain every aspect of Rust; however, you may find it useful while learning Rust. 

I am expanding it as I use and learn this awesome language with my friend [Copilot](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/about-github-copilot). 

Code samples are intentionally simple and as clear as possible. External documentation is referenced when necessary.

Pages with a **WIP** note haven't been reviewed yet, and the information in those pages may contain incorrect information. This project is always a work in progress.

This is a personal project and is not associated with the [Rust Foundation](https://foundation.rust-lang.org/).
