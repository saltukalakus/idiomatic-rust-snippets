### Idiomatic Rust Snippets

Rust is known to have a steep learning curve. This book does not intend to explain every aspect; however, you may find it useful while learning Rust. This is a personal project and is not associated with the [Rust Foundation](https://foundation.rust-lang.org/). 

1. [Essentials](./essentials/intro.md) covers the basic aspects of the Rust programming language. They are explained with easy to understand examples.

2. [Design Patterns](./patterns/intro.md) section demonstrates several design patterns with minimalistic but complete projects.

3. [Anti Patterns](./anti-patterns/intro.md) section explains various non-idiomatic usages that needs to be avoided. 

4. [Algorithms](./algorithms/intro.md) section explains various popular algorithms with code samples in Rust.

The project follows a minimalistic approach, where almost all pages are short with simple, easy-to-follow code samples. Most samples can run. External documentation is referenced when necessary for extended information.
