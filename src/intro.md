### Idiomatic Rust Snippets

Rust is known to have a steep learning curve. This book is intended to be beginner-friendly and get you up to speed with the core Rust concepts and is one of the best "cheat sheets" for Rust developers. 

1. [Essentials](./essentials/intro.md) covers the basic aspects of the Rust programming language. They are explained with easy to understand examples.

2. [Anti Patterns](./anti-patterns/intro.md) section explains various non-idiomatic usages that need to be avoided. This is the best section to read for developers who have started building projects with Rust.

3. [Design Patterns](./patterns/intro.md) section demonstrates several design patterns with minimalistic but complete projects. This section is for more advanced developers and design architects.

4. [Algorithms](./algorithms/intro.md) section explains various popular algorithms with code samples in Rust.

The project follows a minimalistic approach, where almost all pages are short with simple, easy-to-follow code samples. Most samples can run. External documentation is referenced when necessary for extended information.
