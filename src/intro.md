Whether you are a beginner trying to understand ownership or an architect looking for the Rust equivalent of the Strategy pattern, this book cuts through the theory and gives you **working, copy-pasteable and editable interactive examples**. 
Tweak the code, break it, fix it, and see the results instantly.

### 1. [Essentials](./essentials/intro.md)
*For the Developer New to Rust.*
Focuses on the core concepts for beginners: ownership, borrowing, and the type system and a few more.

### 2. [Anti-Patterns](./anti-patterns/intro.md)
*For the Developer Who Got It to Compile (Finally).*
Just because it runs doesn't mean it's right. This section highlights common mistakes developers make when bringing habits from other languages (like manual indexing or ignoring warnings) and shows you the **idiomatic checks and fixes**.

### 3. [Design Patterns](./patterns/intro.md)
*For the Architect & Senior Engineer.*
"How do I implement the Observer pattern without a garbage collector?" This section translates classic GoF patterns into Rust's ownership model, showing you how to build scalable, maintainable systems without fighting the borrow checker.

### 4. [Algorithms](./algorithms/intro.md)
*For the Performance Engineer.*
See how standard algorithms (sorting, searching, graphs) look when implemented with Rust's safety guarantees and zero-cost abstractions.
