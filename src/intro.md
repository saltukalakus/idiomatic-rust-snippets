### Idiomatic Rust Snippets

1- [Essentials](./essentials/intro.md) covers the basic aspects of the Rust programming language. They are explained with easy-to-grasp samples.

2- [Design Patterns](./patterns/intro.md) section demonstrates several design patterns with minimalistic but complete projects.

3- [Algorithms](./algorithms/intro.md) section explains various popular algorithms with code samples in Rust.

This book does not intend to explain every aspect of Rust; however, you may find it useful while learning Rust. 

I am expanding it as I use and learn this awesome language with my friend [Copilot](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/about-github-copilot/what-is-github-copilot) 😆

This is a personal project and is not associated with the [Rust Foundation](https://foundation.rust-lang.org/) in any way.
