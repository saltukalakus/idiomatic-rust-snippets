### Non-Idiomatic Rust Usages

Inspired from [Corroded](https://github.com/buyukakyuz/corroded), this section covers common anti-patterns and non-idiomatic Rust code, along with recommended idiomatic alternatives. Learning what not to do is just as important as learning best practices.

Understanding these anti-patterns helps writing more idiomatic, efficient, and maintainable Rust code by recognizing and avoiding common pitfalls.

1- [Ownership and Memory](./ownership-memory/intro.md): Anti-patterns related to ownership, borrowing, lifetimes, and memory management.

2- [Error Handling](./error-handling/intro.md): Common mistakes in handling errors with `Result`, `Option`, and panic scenarios.

3- [Code Structure](./code-structure/intro.md): Anti-patterns in code organization, control flow, and leveraging language features.

4- [Type System](./type-system/intro.md): Misuses of Rust's type system, including string handling and type conversions.
