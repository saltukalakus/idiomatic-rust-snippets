# [Idiomatic Rust Snippets](https://idiomatic-rust-snippets.org/)

Rust is known to have a steep learning curve. This book does not intend to explain every aspect of Rust; however, you may find it useful while learning Rust. 

I am expanding it as I use and learn this awesome language. It is my memory map and grows organically.

Please like, share, and contribute. All pull requests are welcome.
