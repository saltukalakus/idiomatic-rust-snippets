# [Idiomatic Rust Snippets](https://idiomatic-rust-snippets.org/)

Rust is known to have a steep learning curve. This book does not intend to explain every aspect of Rust; however, you may find it useful while learning Rust. 

I am expanding it as I use and learn this awesome language with my friend [Copilot](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/about-github-copilot/what-is-github-copilot) 😆. Pages with a **WIP** note haven't been reviewed and the information in those pages may have incorrect information. 

This is a personal project and is not associated with the Rust Foundation in any way.

Please like ⭐️⭐️⭐️, share, and contribute. All pull requests are welcome.
