# [Idiomatic Rust Snippets](https://idiomatic-rust-snippets.org/)

Rust is known to have a steep learning curve. This book does not intend to explain every aspect of Rust; however, you may find it useful while learning Rust. 

1. [Essentials](./essentials/intro.md) covers the basic aspects of the Rust programming language. They are explained with easy-to-understand examples.

2. [Design Patterns](./patterns/intro.md) section demonstrates several design patterns with minimalistic but complete projects.

3. [Algorithms](./algorithms/intro.md) section explains various popular algorithms with code samples in Rust. (WIP)

Code samples are intentionally simple and as clear as possible. External documentation is referenced when necessary.

Pages with a **WIP** note haven't been reviewed yet, and the information in those pages may contain incorrect information. This project is a work in progress.

This is a personal project and is not associated with the [Rust Foundation](https://foundation.rust-lang.org/). 

Last but not least, please like ⭐️⭐️⭐️ [the project](https://github.com/saltukalakus/idiomatic-rust-snippets) on Github if you find it useful. This is a great motivation to keep the project active.
